The map of us doesn’t have to only be a relationship story like with another person. It could also be a courier journey. Basically you started from this job and then you ended up here how that life-cycle event even for restaurants or business owners how imagine they started by a small shop where the shop was located and they did pop-ups in different different places and then then ended up opening the big store so could be like a journey for their business or journey for their career so it could be for anything not just limited to relationships but mine is a limit of how you wanna plan something out. It could be a vacation journey you took with your family. Something small doesn’t have to be just between two people could be a group thing as well
so what I do is I map out the whole story from the buildings to the dates that happen to small little decoration pieces of you know the background of the whole data or something like that the dialogues you said that made you laugh out loud or an activity your character was just doodling your stickman figures and everything so it is a very detailed very highly like literally going into depth of your story and trying to make that come to life in a physical form that you can see and show others which is very beautiful it’s a beautiful thing to put in your home. It’s a great wedding gift to give to someone someone.
there’s many other uses for the map as well as it. It is a high high resolution digital file so you can use a multiple times you can make it a colouring book for your children will be so cute because then your children will be colouring their parents story or it could be when you have a scrapbook with your person and that could be the first page of that scrapbook or a book if you ever do end of writing a book that could be it doesn’t have to be a relationship journey it could also be like your your career journey how you started where you started to go on your biography book if you ever try to write one you could print them out and that would be so cute as well to give it to a significant other like could be your thing you know you always gift using the wrapping paper for weddings if you do when you do get married hopefully you know like at the entrance you could have like a big huge frame laying there that’s like you know, like we all begin or from the first message to yes and then there’s your whole storyyou can make a jigsaw puzzle out of it and they give that and the whistle cool for a couple of best friends to bond over like even if
you’re in long distance it would be a very great anniversary gift. You can put it on two bags or T-shirts, your wallpaper or anything like it’s on your bedside and everything so you couldn’t get multiple uses as it is a high resolution file so you can use it as many times as you want. you could also get it as a group like you know a group of five friends they get their The Place where they all met or they slowly slowly started meeting one person whoever another person got a group and then they all veered on a T-shirt together or get a big fame for their friendship like a story about the whole friendship that’s a very cute thing to, get made
there’s three packages there is basic
Standard and premium, so the difference between dentistry is basic is five locations standard is eight locations and premium is to a vacations and another differences in basic you will have five location but they won’t be timeline supported like it won’t be like this is like the whole journey won’t be mapped out based on the time like first comes first standard and female day however they would have the timeline like the first thing that happens. I will be in the first 50 dates and it would line wise aligned.
